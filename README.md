## User Story 
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engine

## Acceptance Criteria 
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

All code used was source code, I only added to it.
